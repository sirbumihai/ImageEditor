Image Processing Playground
This project is a comprehensive image processing application built with JavaScript. It allows users to load random dog images from an API and apply various image processing techniques on them.

Key Features:

Image Loading: The application fetches random dog images from the 'dog.ceo' API and displays them on a canvas. The JSON response from the API is also displayed on the page.

Image Processing: The application processes the loaded image in four steps, each step processing a quarter of the image. The processing time for each step is calculated and displayed on the page.

Image Filters: The application provides a dropdown menu for users to select and apply various image filters. The filters include grayscale, color normalization, Sobel operator, Prewitt operator, image sharpening, image smoothing, mirror image, binary operation, and many more. The application of the filter results in the image being updated on the canvas.

Error Handling: The application includes error handling for image loading and processing, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project is a great resource for those interested in understanding how image processing works in JavaScript. It provides a hands-on, interactive way to see the effects of various image processing techniques.
